# Elm Debugger - [live online](http://debug.elm-lang.org/)

The debugger was conceived and implemented by [Laszlo
Pandy](https://github.com/laszlopandy/). He introduced it during [his
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK0vph1zR8s&list=PLrJ2mLJTxzXcBvJr5iZKetpeqHOJYJ8AW)
at [Elm Workshop 2013](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzbnVYNyCwES9u3dqYZ-0WQ/videos).
Since then it has been adopted by [the @elm-lang organization](https://github.com/elm-lang).

Nowadays, the concepts from the debugger live on in
[elm-reactor](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor), which is part of the
[elm-platform](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform), and is proving very valuable
in everyday use.

**You normally shouldn't need to build the debugger from this repo here anymore.**

Further development happens in the [elm-reactor repo](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor).
Please contribute there!
